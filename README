  // Still debating on if this is going to break the game after implementing multiple classes
  // In the future there are plans of adding 4 different factions (Human, Undead, Zombie, Dwarf) 
  // and these factions will have a right click option that will show a special move
  // an original idea is that zombies will have a special "Resurrection" move that can happen
  // after a set amount of turns, they can resurrect 1 pawn per resurrection and can only 
  // resurrect a pawn that has been killed; also the resurrected pawn can't be resurrected
  // past half field.
